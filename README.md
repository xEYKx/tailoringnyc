I am recreating a website for a brand/company that I used to co-own with a business partner. 
My role encompassed business development and sales, as well as overseeing the website. 
Following the closure of the business during the COVID-19 pandemic, I wanted to determine if 
I could rebuild the website with the features I had previously hired developers to implement. 
I believed these features were necessary to automate appointment scheduling and expand our customer base.
